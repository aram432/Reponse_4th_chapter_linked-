Small Worlds

The fourth chapter revealed a very interesting idea about networks; weak ties create stron connections. 
A lot of people get jobs through weak connections, not through close family or friends. In the retrospect, such phenomenon
does make sense in that job offer is rather a delicate issue and I myself would not want to risk companionship in more
pragmatic disputes. Still, the result is quite counterintuitive - importance of weak connection is still an literal irony. 

What I found meaningful about the research is that data reveals conclusions that might go against our preliminary instinct. 
More interesting is the clustering coefficient; the idea behind clustering coefficient is quite simple, but it suggests powerful
measure about the ties in the group. Given that weak ties make strong connections, we might be able to assess the possibility of
stronger connection among clusters with different clustering coefficient. 

Watts and Strogatz have concluded that even a few extra nodes drastically increases the connection between nodes. This might be
a supporting intuition behind the exponential growth of the network - that above a certain threshold, power of network increases 
drastically. 

Still the idea that seems to continuously pose doubt on theory of networks (and its potentials) is the innate randomeness in the
networks. While I do agree to the idea of randomess in network, it feels like quite a stretch to claim randomness even after the 
network has started forming some meaningful connections. Perhaps there is a number that creates some connections after the threshold
of nodes.
