IoT Device: Connected Chocolate

Connect temperature sensor to chocolate wrapper (ideally, chocolates that have fillings inside like Lindor balls or Ferrero Rocher - if 
the sensor gets cheap enough)

For each variety of product, set the temperature for which the filling inside are not totally solidfied (its very difficult to unsolidify
the fillings, like nutella inside Ferrero Rocher once it congeals) 

If the connection works led blink will indicate whether all chocolates are in good store. 
Sensor is attached at the middle of the box to assess the general temperature inside
